### Note
* Please STAR ⭐️ this project if it helps you.

### Description
Replication of state-of-the-art Encrypted Traffic Classification methods based on Pytorch.

### Dataset
Our encrypted traffic classification tasks are designed based on three of the most widely used datasets, including ISCX-VPN, ISCX-TOR and USTC-TFC, which can be obtained from Baidu Cloud or downloaded from the dataset source address for ease of use.  **_(链接: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AyMzsJGfc_iIBjL8hokvqA 提取码: cgv1)_**
